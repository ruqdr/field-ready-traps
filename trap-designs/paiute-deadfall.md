# Paiute Deadfall Trap

## Principle
A simple and ancient trigger mechanism that uses a sensitive balance to release a heavy rock or log when an animal disturbs the bait.

## Materials
- Heavy rock or log (the "deadfall")
- Three straight sticks: a vertical support, a diagonal support, and a bait stick.
- Bait (e.g., peanut butter, seeds)

## Assembly Instructions
1. Place the vertical support stick.
2. Lean the diagonal support against it, creating a 45-degree angle.
3. Carefully balance the edge of the deadfall on the top of the diagonal support.
4. Place the bait stick between the bottom of the deadfall and the vertical support, with the bait at the far end. This stick holds the entire mechanism in place.
5. When an animal takes the bait, the bait stick dislodges, causing the trap to spring.
